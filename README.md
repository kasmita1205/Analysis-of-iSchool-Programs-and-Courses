Study the evolution of the Information Sciences programs and courses over the years.

### Introduction
Often students while looking up for their dream universities and programs don’t get access to
proper statistics which could help them compare the different options available and make
informed decisions. Also, schools and colleges lack information through which they can
evaluate their performance over the years and improve the quality in future. Hence, as
students at the School of Information Sciences, we tried to study the evolution of the
information sciences programs and courses over the years.
We have created several interactive dashboard using Tableau which can benefit new aspirants
to have a quick look at the statistics about the iSchool and support their decision-making
process. Also, this dashboard can be used by the iSchool officials to evaluate the performance
and popularity of the programs and come up with strategies to improve their quality.

### Dataset
We have collected data from two major sources - University of Illinois, Division Of
Management Information’s website and Eddie Web Intelligence Tool. From DMI we
collected data regarding the total enrollment by majors, race, gender and residency. Using
Eddie we gathered data about the courses like the faculty name, number of students enrolled
and number of seat available, etc.
The data on Division Of Management Information’s website is available on a semester wise
basis. We had to download the data for each semester from Fall 2017 to Spring 2022 and then
merge them into a single file for our analysis. The second challenge with this DMI data was
that, all the semester’s data did not contain the same number of headers so we had to
manually consider this and merge all the semester files together.

### Data Preparation
The data received from DMI and Eddie were not in ready to use format. So, we used Tableau
Prep Builder to prepare our data which we fed to Tableau for creating the desired
visualisations. 

### Analysis
The detailed analysis and report can be found in the project report attached.

### Future Work
With this project we would like to dig deeper into analysing admission criteria for ischool
programs by studying parameters like number of applicants, gpa, exam scores, work
experience of applicants and acceptance rate etc. which would further help aspirants to
analyse their application while applying for programs at iSchool and also help iSchool to
keep a check on quality of students that are admitted to different programs. We also look
forward to seek suggestions and feedback from iSchool authorities and implementing them in
our project.
